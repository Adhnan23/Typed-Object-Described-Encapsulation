# Typed-Object-Described-Encapsulation
.tode (Typed Object Described Encapsulation) is a new human-readable data format designed to replace JSON in scenarios where type safety, schema validation, and compactness are required.  It combines the human-friendliness of YAML, the type-safety of TypeScript, and the compactness of Protobuf, while remaining fully self-contained and API-ready.
